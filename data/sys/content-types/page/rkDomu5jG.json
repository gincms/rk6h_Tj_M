  "body": "### Fees\r\n\r\nLamboMoon has a variable mining fee that decreases from 5% to 1% as the number of miners and amount of hashing power increases. This is to ensure that the costs of running the pool can be met *and contributions can be made* to the coin communities, while keeping miners' rewards as high as possible.\r\n\r\n#### How much does it cost to run this pool?\r\n\r\nSo glad you asked! LamboMoon aims to be as transparent as possible about the running costs of the pool and the revenue earned – below is a brief breakdown of both. These figures are approximate but more detailed and accurate info will be made available very soon.\r\n\r\n|                 |                                                                                                              \r\n------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nProvider                                                                | [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/)\r\nAverage monthly cost                                      | **$232.28**  \r\nAverage monthly revenue                              | **$141.00**\r\nRevenue after donation                                  | **$130**\r\nAverage profit                                                    | **-$101.28**\r\n\r\nEach coin uses RAM and disk space – *lots of disk space* – to store each cryptocurrency's entire blockchain. Things get costly fairly quickly, and as LamboMoon is still in its infancy, it operates at a loss. As it grows and starts to turn profit, the mining fee will be decreased incrementally to allow the pool to *at least* break even. This will continue until the mining fee reaches 1%.\r\n\r\n\r\n### LamboMoon donates\r\n\r\nLamboMoon currently donates 10% of the mining fee (0.5% of the block reward) to the projects listed below. The percentage donated from the block reward remains fixed, so that as the mining fee decreases, the percentage donated from it *increases*.\r\n\r\nIn other words, once the mining fee decreases to 1%, **we'll be donating 50%** of the mining fee to these projects:\r\n\r\n[BitcoinZ](https://btcz.rocks): t1fHHnAXxoPWGY77sG5Zw2sFfGUTpW6BcSZ  \r\n[SnowGem](https://snowgem.org): s1aUpbqEWaKoj54t7d3LCf9hMmnCXJdBDvt  \r\n[Hush](https://myhush.org): t1b1Hvhc9PWFPnP4mgG4Yj2hiNUrKkP7dZ2\r\n\r\n### Donate to LamboMoon\r\n\r\nIf you would like to support this pool, you can donate to any — or all ;-) — of the following addresses:\r\n\r\n**BTCZ**: t1UBwvprfqGyPcwe5WNy7tzFSHavbNpoy2Z  \r\n**SNG**: s1imAACaSMHTzK3LSWVmLWs9riVfSN3Xycb  \r\n**BTC**: 1GeqKUpLxcUfFNJSLatFvJqDpNEWYpnXJ6  \r\n**ETH**: 0x99edfc880a899bf290890a9a169d5b9e0c96c8cc  \r\n**EOS**: 0xba0351134b556521a6af99860d3147ed738ef93a",
