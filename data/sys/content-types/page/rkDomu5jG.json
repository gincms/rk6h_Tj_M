This is to ensure that the costs of running the pool can be met and contributions can be made to the coin communities, while keeping miners' rewards as high as possible.\r\n\r\nRemember that mining on a pool with fewer miners (such as LamboMoon) means that you earn more because you share the block rewards with fewer people.\r\n\r\n### LamboMoon donates\r\n\r\nA portion of the fees on LamboMoon are donated to the following project addresses:\r\n\r\n[BitcoinZ](http://btcz.rocks): t1fHHnAXxoPWGY77sG5Zw2sFfGUTpW6BcSZ  \r\n[SnowGem](http://snowgem.org): s1aUpbqEWaKoj54t7d3LCf9hMmnCXJdBDvt  \r\n\r\n### Donate to LamboMoon\r\n\r\nIf you would like to support this pool, you can donate to any — or all ;-) — of the following addresses:\r\n\r\n**BTCZ**: t1UBwvprfqGyPcwe5WNy7tzFSHavbNpoy2Z  \r\n**SNG**: s1imAACaSMHTzK3LSWVmLWs9riVfSN3Xycb  \r\n**BTC**: 1GeqKUpLxcUfFNJSLatFvJqDpNEWYpnXJ6  \r\n**ETH**: 0x99edfc880a899bf290890a9a169d5b9e0c96c8cc  \r\n**EOS**: 0xba0351134b556521a6af99860d3147ed738ef93a",
