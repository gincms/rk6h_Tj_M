Block rewards are paid early and often. Just take your pick and [start mining altcoins](/)!\r\n\r\nThis pool supports the community by contributing a portion of the fee to the projects listed (see info). It also contributes time directly to some of these projects. By mining with LamboMoon, you're also supporting these projects, by helping to keep network hashing power more evenly distributed. This prevents other pools from growing too large; a pool that has too much hashing power on any one network increases the risk of a majority attack (AKA 51% attack).\r\n\r\nCentralised network hash is bad. Protect the network. Make mining decentralised again! ;-)",
